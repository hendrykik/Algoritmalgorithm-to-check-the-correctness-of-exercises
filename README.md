Implementation of a pose estimation algorithm and application for the analysis of exercise correctness

The main code is in main.py. 
The aim of this work is to develop and implement a pose estimation algorithm that will form the foundation of a desktop application. This application is designed to analyze the accuracy of performing strength exercises, such as the classic barbell squat and deadlift. Its main task will be to provide users with detailed advice on improving their exercise techniques and form, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of their workouts and reducing the risk of injuries
